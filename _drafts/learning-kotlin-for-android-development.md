Developing and deploying an Android app in the Google Play Store was one of the original reasons that got me interested in programming. Although I had developed some small apps way back in my undergrad, I have not looked in that direction for a long time now. A lot has changed since I last looked into Android development. Tools have evolved, languages like Kotlin have boomed and frameworks like Flutter are gaining traction in the app development space. What better time refresh my skills and once again explore the app development space

So here I am, attempting to learn a new language Kotlin. Let's see if I can make some useful app on the way.

I already went through some of the documentation of the Kotlin Android Development. It's a great resource for anyone planning to get started on Kotlin based Android development. If you haven't already checked it out, I highly recommend it. So I have already built few of their beginner apps - a birthday card app, a dice app and a *XXXXXX* app to name a few. But during all of these, I was just following along the instructions. This is _my_ first Kotlin Android app.

Since COVID is the hot topic now, let's build an app for Vaccination. The government of India has published the APIs for finding availability of vaccines. Let's build an app which would keep monitoring the Covid vaccine appoinment availability and notify us whenever a slot opens up in your area.
